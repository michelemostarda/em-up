==This section explains the _JSONPath_ operation.==

The JSON Path operation implements a subset of the {{{JSONPath}}}
specification defined [http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath here]
and allows to address and extract sub elements of a JSON data.

JSON Path is used by  *MU* to decompose JSON values.

The {{{JSONPath}}} syntax has been formalized in a grammar called _JP_.

The full _JP_ specification and samples can be found [JPSyntax here].
