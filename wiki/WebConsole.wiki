This section describes the MUp's _Web Console_ and related _Tools_.

The Web Console is an interactive web based shell-like console.
It is meant to help the user in developing and refining MU code.

The console is based on GWT and gwt-ext widgets.
The console supports a set of tool to inspect objects (as JSON structures)
and the program context.

==Console==

The console is shown below:

We can see mainly a command input area in the bottom side, and an execution 
history on the central panel. The execution history shows a list of entries,
every entry contains the executed program text, the result and an eventual
error description. The command result shows a list of possible tools applicable
on it to have a better editing.

==Tools==

===JSON Inspector===

The _JSON Inspector_ is a tool useful to navigate and modify JSON objects.
It is composed of an _editable tree view_ and an editable text view,
double synchronized. Any modification in a view can be reported on the other
view.
