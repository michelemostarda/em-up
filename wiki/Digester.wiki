==This section explains the _Digester_ module.==

The _Digester_ module provides a set of _inspection_ predicates
used by _MU_ to decompose XML / SGML data retrieved from Web.

THe Digester supports a subset of the _XPath_ language, meant to perform forward
selection. The forward selection is a selection that can be done in streaming, with
no backtracking required.

This language subset is called *XP*.

The full digester _XP_ specification and samples can be found [XPSyntax here].
