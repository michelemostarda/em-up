===Introduction===

The _Processor_ module is responsible of executing the program generated
by the _Parser_ module, handling the execution stack, and the execution
context.

The main classes of the processor module and their relationship are shown 
in the figure below.

  #{{{OperationsSequence}}}: defines a sequence of operations.
  #{{{Invocable}}}: defines the access point of a sequence of operations.
  #{{{AbstractOperation}}}: base class used to extend an operation accepting arguments.
  #{{{Signature}}}: defines the signature of an _invocable_ operation's sequence.
  #{{{ExecutionStack}}}: the stack of the _MU Processor_.
  #{{{ExecutionContext}}}: the context defining operations and variables of the _MU Processor_.
